# Project Deep Green Ocean
A portfolio website for Jimmy by Jimmy

This is the first iteration of the site, which is not very user friendly
due to: slow loadspeed (more than 5s), high system requirements (three js animations).
Please visit the dev branch for the second iteration

It is composed of two sections: a
[front end SPA](https://bitbucket.org/Rocket-Fish/project-deep-green/src/840a607548eddb0e7b15bfd2e910636d075cc0fb/resources/js/?at=master) powered by Vue.js,
and a
[backend](https://bitbucket.org/Rocket-Fish/project-deep-green/src/840a607548eddb0e7b15bfd2e910636d075cc0fb/resources/views/?at=master) powered by Laravel.

Currently, the project is relatively small, so certain portions are hardcoded
and unscalable. Only the Projects page, interacts with the backend.

Major rewrites planned in future iterations of the project as it expands.
